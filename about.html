<!-- Create a webpage to convey how Foodar works. This content should be in a file called about.html. 
The <title> should be About Foodar
The page should contain the name of the company on the top-left side
The page should contain a heading <h1>, that says, "How it Works!"
The page should contain 3 paragraphs <p>, that contain text from the wireframe -->

 <!-- Now that you know some basic styling you can use CSS to edit the About page.

Since all you know now is how to change the colors and background of an element(s), experiment with colors that you find appealing. 

NOTE: You should write your CSS in a separate file (layout.css or style.css). You won't turn in this file until the very end (Dive 6) of this project.  -->
